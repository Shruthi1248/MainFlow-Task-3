# MainFlow-Task-3

# Overview

  This Task demonstrates how to use Matplotlib to create different types of visualizations such as Scatter Plots, Bar Charts, and Line charts from Pandas DataFrames. It also covers essential customization techniques like Adding Titles, Labels, and Legends to make visualizations 

# Key Features

  Scatter Plots: Represent relationships between two Continuous Variables.
  
  Bar Charts: Display the comparison of discrete Categories.
  
  Line Charts: Show trends over time or other Continuous Data.

  Histogram: Represent the distribution of a Dataset.
  
  ## Customizations:
    
  ## Titles: Make visualizations more descriptive.
      
  ## Axis Labels: Clarify the meaning of the x and y axes.
      
  ## Legends: Differentiate between multiple data series.
      
      
# Usage

Data Visualization: Use Matplotlib to create various plots like scatter, bar, and line charts to visually represent the data.

Customizing Plots: Add titles, labels, and legends to your charts for clarity and to make the visualizations more informative.

Comparing Data: Use bar and line charts to compare categories or trends over time, helping in understanding patterns or changes in your dataset.

Visual Analysis: Quickly identify relationships, distributions, and trends in your data by visualizing it using scatter plots and other chart types.
